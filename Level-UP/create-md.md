# How to create a Markdown document?

You have your profile, your own repository, next step is to create your first Markdown document on GitHub.

1. Go on the repository of your choice, it can be yours, the one you created a few minutes ago. 
You can easily found it by going on your profile.

2. Click on "Create new file"

3. Name your file as you want + add ".md" at the end. This extension is specific to Markdown.   
We advice you to use our [naming convention](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/blob/891cee5a70a51c7256b687a5971c4697ffca2d10/xx-src/naming-convention.md): "something-like-this".  
In this example, we decide to create a "README" (one of the rare cases in which you should use uppercase) document, it's used to describe your repository, to tell other people why your project is useful, how they can use it, how they can contribute, ...

As you can see, Markdown documents got specific syntax rules. 
Here's a [tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/), with small exercices, to master them, but no need to go that far for your first one. One tip for you, if you want to have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces. Otherwise, you'll have everything on one single straight line.  

4. When it's done, you can click on the "Commit new file" green button, at the bottom of what you wrote.

Let's see what's the result in the example we used:  
As you can see, in some cases there are line break (two trailing spaces), in other cases there aren't (no two trailing spaces). We also added an image, emphasize "best project".
