# How to create your first repository?

Now that you got your awesome profile, let's see how to create your repository.  

First things first, what's a repository (repo for those in the know)?  
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, 
images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs.  

Once again, as (almost) everything in GitHub, it's easy-peasy:

1. Click on the "+" button, on the top right, close to your awesome profile pic.  
2. Click on the "New repository" button, as you might have guessed.  
3. Name your repository as you want to name it, could be the name of one of your project.    
4. Write a short description if you want.  
5. We advice you to select "Initialize this repository with a README." (can still do it later).  

**Big success!**
