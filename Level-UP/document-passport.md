# How to document the realization of your maker passport?

If you are currently reading this, you should have finished to make your own passport. You had plenty of help to go until this stage. Now it's time to show what you know, what you can do. It's farely easy, create a document ([Markdown](create-md.md) for example) in your own [repository](create-repo.md), name it following our [naming convention](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/blob/891cee5a70a51c7256b687a5971c4697ffca2d10/xx-src/naming-convention.md). Then build your own tutorial, explain what you think is important to explain, your choices, the techniques you used, ... It's up to you.

Once again, documenting isn't just to make you waste your time, it'll help us improve the passport, the tutorial we did, ...

It's your time to shine, show your talent! When it's done, the only thing remaining to be sure you are a SuperUser is to set up a permanent standing order of 34â‚¬/month to [Syntonie ASBL](http://openfab.be/adhesion). Almost done :)
